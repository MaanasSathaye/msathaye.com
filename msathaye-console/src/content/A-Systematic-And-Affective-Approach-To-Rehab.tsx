        As a personal addendum, you should probably stop listening to randos on the internet. But,
        because of this medical disclaimer and the nebulous web that is potential liability,
        I&apos;m going to phrase the rest of this post as &quot;how I approach my own rehab and
        recovery&quot;.

        Rehab and recovery in sport is a highly divisive and lucrative industry; it&apos;s expected
        to be a $10.82B market with 6.6% CAGR by 2033.<sup>1</sup> Pessimistically, this is a
        combination of misaligned incentives in traditional healthcare, misinformation ingested by
        unaware or gullible consumers, and historical or emotional predilections. Optimistically,
        this is because young adults are starting to view healthcare as self-care (and enjoy the
        control that comes with it).<sup>2</sup> But, as a working individual with a busy schedule,
        I don&apos;t overcomplicate rehab and recovery; unlike Lebron James, I don&apos;t get paid
        to stay in shape all year, and I&apos;m short a few zeroes to afford that anyway. I usually
        start with a &quot;systems check&quot;.

        The two questions I ask myself when injury occurs are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Was the injury due to sudden trauma (e.g. a barbell was dropped on a body part, falling
            off monkey bars,{' '}

              hit by Sean Taylor
            </a>
            ). These are injuries that could cause adrenaline spikes and dumps, impairing a
            &quot;true&quot; read of a potentially dangerous situation. If I don&apos;t immediately
            seek medical attention afterwards, I should at least entertain a second opinion from
            those who witnessed the injury, close friends, or family.
          </li>
          <li>
            Can I walk with less than 4/10 pain on the universal pain scale? If the answer is no,
            but the injury wasn&apos;t a result of trauma, OTC pain-killers <em>may</em> help. If
            they don&apos;t, I should probably seek medical attention. If the answer is yes (or
            eventually becomes yes after OTC medication), I know I&apos;m entering a period of
            recovery.

        I have dual goals in recovery: recovering as effectively as possible and lowering future
        incidence rates. Therefore, I have to weigh the time, effort, and money required for all of
        these options. Foam rolling, massage guns, and e-stim devices tick all three boxes;
        they&apos;re time-friendly, low-effort, and cheap. However, I don&apos;t typically go for
        these options because I find the benefit towards lowering future injury risk minimal, and
        meta-analysis agrees.<sup>3, 4, 5</sup> Massages, compression devices, and hot/cold therapy
        are generally more expensive and/or less readily available. However, they are similarly
        ineffective (or under-researched) in reducing future injury risk for healthy individuals.
        <sup>6, 7</sup> Keeping in mind that pain is a signal, and &quot;pain management&quot; is
        the act of increasing the threshold at which pain occurs by lowering the intesity of pain
        and decreasing the incidence rate, I&apos;ve found the listed active recovery methods to be
        more beneficial for me. I average 10k steps/day thanks to my dogs (that number is
        arbitrarily set as my goal, there&apos;s little to no research for that benchmark). As a
        weightlifter, I am no stranger to low back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, and more. Rest
        has been shown to be less effective in return to activity and future injury prevention in
        patients with low back pain; the same can be said for knee and shoulder pain.
        <sup>8, 9, 10</sup> I should also mention that all of these solutions are free,
        time-efficient, and require moderate effort at most. I tend to pick proprioceptive exercises
        that are &quot;highly modular and configurable&quot;, i.e. they can be performed in high-rep
        sets and progressed over time to increase the difficulty as pain lessens. For example,
        I&apos;ve progressed hip drops for lateral hip pain by increasing the distance that my
        dangling leg lowers and by increasing the time taken for a single rep in the exercise.

        brings up a good point. So far, I&apos;ve dogged on passive recovery with no empathetic
        considerations. I should clarify that I like passive recovery for{' '}
        <em>managing my emotional state</em> and getting that sweet endorphin hit. Massages feel and
        hot/cold therapy feel good, man! In a hypothetical scenario where I&apos;m forced to choose
        between complete rest and passive recovery, I&apos;m choosing the latter every time; that
        scenario has yet to happen to me. But motivation, like strength, attention span, and energy,
        fluctuates depending on the surrounding context. A long day of work and dogs sometimes makes
        even the simplest proprioceptive training seem ostensibly difficult. And, in the end,{' '}
        <em>motion is lotion</em>. A simple rule I place on myself is that I never do more than 25%
        passive recovery - if I&apos;ve had a particularly long week of work and done active
        recovery on most days, then I&apos;m more inclined to splurge on a massage or visit a sauna.
