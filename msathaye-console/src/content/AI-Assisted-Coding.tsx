      <h2></h2>
      <h2>"This is just a new skill."</h2>
      <h3> You do not understand skill attribution, and is this a skill worth learning?</h3>
      <h3>
        This is the argument that drives me insane. Let's take this step by step (pun intended). No
        skill worth learning is free lunch; you must put in the reps! Now, ask anyone that's worked
        on perfecting their craft. There's no 'faking' the work. You have to find ways to enjoy it.
        You compete with yourself to be better than you were yesterday, or last week, or last month.
        You compete with your peers. You document your learnings. You sacrifice. But when you love
        what you do, you learn to love progressing your skill, hitting milestones, 'leveling up'.
        I'm a strong believer in "how you do one thing is how you do everything". In other words,
        getting good at one skill helps you get good at another skill. Now let's think about the
        original context. Is prompting a skill you really want to improve on? Is a "prompt engineer"
        role something you want to put in the hours to distinguish yourself for? How does
        understanding the best way to communicate with this human-made, mostly black box system help
        you in other areas of your life? If you're going to say 'it helps me communicate', I dare
        you to look at the last 100 request logs with your copilot. How many frustrated cap locks
        arguments did you initiate? But, I digress. Do you see the point?
      </h3>
      <h2>Learning from High Performance Elsewhere</h2>
      <h3>
        There are many ways to explain this point, but the one that I think is the easiest to
        understand, and the one I can relate to the most, is sports performance. No athlete on this
        planet performs at 100% for 365 days a year. Strength athletes use periodization to maximize
        training adaptations and minimize injury risk. NBA Teams are increasingly load managing to
        keep their stars healthy for deep playoff runs.
      </h3>
      <br></br>
      <h3>
        But, good luck telling your employer that you're "load managing" this week.<sup>*</sup> And
        that's my point. It's unrealistic to expect any engineer to work at 100% efficacy for 320+
        days out of the year. Like athletes, our readiness for problem-solving undulates. Long
        stretches of unmotivated, uninspired work can be “averaged out” by copilots, letting you
        find the magic again when you’re ready. Code quality is an extremely valid concern, but it’s
        less of a concern for someone with the years of experience who has the wisdom and keen eye
        to rule out poor suggestions from LLMs. “The scenario where you describe acceptable llm use
        is known as burnout” well, yes. But the cure to burnout is a break from your job or
        programming in general, and some people simply can’t afford that (due to lack of PTO or
        otherwise). Therefore, I think it's fair to say that copilot programming raises the baseline
        output of a salaried engineer however you choose to mesaure it.

        <em>
          <sup>*</sup> To be clear, a version of "load managing" exists - explicitly lighter
          workload days. I've used these before, and they're helpful. But, they're not "restful". If
          anything, they're tiny morale boosts that help engineers fend off burnout or imposter
          syndrome.

      <h2>Forgive Me, Guido, For I Have Sinned</h2>
      <h3>
        Confession time: I don't like Python. I have no qualms with the authors and maintainers, but
        I believe the way the ecosystem has evolved is an anti-pattern to deploying resilient,
        maintainable, and efficient services. Important context here: I'm a Golang/Rust guy. Python
        burns (and bums) me out quicker than any other language, and in this specific scenario, I
        believe copilot programming is a great way for me to continue solving business problems for
        my employer at minimal risk to my sanity.

          <sup>*</sup> Senior engineers, yes, this is a skill issue. I will be the first to admit
          it. But of all the skills in my life I could sharpen (and all the time I could spend
          sharpening them), Python is at the bottom of the list. That's personal preference, and
          that's OK. More research on{' '}
