At the end of the year, I like to post some books and papers (both good and bad) I've read since January 1<sup>st</sup> and give some personal thoughts and recommendations. I usually do this on Instagram stories, but keeping a permanent running list is something I've wanted to do. Since this is the first edition on my website, I'll post a non-exhaustive list of my all-time favorite books to provide readers some context.

## 2024

### *Behave - Dr. Robert Sapolsky*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Biology-Humans-Best-Worst/dp/009957506X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

Emotional intelligence meets biology meets mythbusters. Good science communication is extremely difficult, but this book seems oblivious to that fact. The book references many old and new studies without getting bland. It's on the denser side, but I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in interpersonal connections.

### *Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

</a>

I read this directly after *Behave* as my brain needed a break from nonfiction. I probably could have read the entire book in a day. Loved the writing style and storyline. Hope the upcoming movie holds up to the book.

### *The Spy and The Traitor - Ben Macintyre*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spy-Traitor-Greatest-Espionage-Story/dp/1101904216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={tsatt} alt="The Spy and The Traitor Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

Cold War. Espionage. Family ties. Political chess. Hot extractions. I recommend the book if you're interested in any of those.

### *Writing an Interpreter in Go - Thorsten Ball*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Interpreter-Go-Thorsten-Ball/dp/300055808X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={iig} alt="Writing an Interpreter in Go Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

I've been wanting to read the sequel to this book, *Writing a Compiler in Go*, for a while now. I figured I'd start with the prequel first. It's succinct and includes code examples and explanations.

### *The Anxious Generation - Dr. Jonathan Haidt*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={tag} alt="The Anxious Generation Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

This was recommended to me after I read *Dopamine Nation*. This book is another good example of science communication done well. My only gripe is that *some* citations reference news media statistics, which could probably (maybe easily?) be replaced with some double blind, RCTs.

### *What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory - Ulrich Drepper*

<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={wepskam} alt="What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory Paper Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

This is a paper written in 2007, but many of the principles still hold. It's 5 chapters of dense architecture diagrams and physical memory layouts, but the 6th chapter makes it all worth it.

## My Goats

### *The Sports Gene - David Epstein*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Athletic-Performance/dp/161723012X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={sg} alt="The Sports Gene Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

Remember what I said about science communication? Yeah, this one is excellent.

### *Dopamine Nation - Dr. Anna Lembke*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={dn} alt="Dopamine Nation Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />
</a>

Cover states it well already. Wish this book had more neuroscience considerations, but the subject matter makes it relevant enough.

### *Fathers and Sons - Ivan Turgenev*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fathers-Sons-Penguin-Classics-Turgenev/dp/014144133X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={fathersandsons} alt="Fathers and Sons Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />

"As we all know, time sometimes flies like a bird, and sometimes crawls like a worm, but people may be unusually happy when they do not even notice whether time has passed quickly or slowly."

### *Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppman*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <Image src={ddia} alt="Designing Data Intensive Applications Book Cover" width={250} class="my-4" />

hog book supremacy.

### *The Sport is Steroids*

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sport-Steroids-Athletes-Quest-Records-ebook/dp/B08KT7MD9B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

Fairness in sport is harder than you think.
