        I graduated with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UT Austin. Upon graduating, I had two
        choices in Texas: oil and gas (in the middle of nowhere) or the &quot;materials science
        internship lottery&quot; (1 available position between thousands of graduates). I found a
        third option - working minimum wage as a &quot;Chemical Software Intern&quot;.
